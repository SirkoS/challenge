# variables
This is a repository of I-ADOPT variables and can serve as a knowledge base for I-ADOPT variable decomposition.


Use the repository' issues to discuss the decomposition of variables instances into atomic concepts where you want to get feedback from the I-ADOPT modelling group. We recommend to define a property with a knowledge of the dimension or most common units used for the variable in order to not have to guess if the description is correct. Therefore we ask, if possible, to add units and dimensionts when we submitting an example for decomposition. In addition, please also submit a link to a publication or webpage describing the variable.
