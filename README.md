# variables
This is a repository of I-ADOPT variables. 
Use the repository' issues to discuss the decomposition of variables into atomic concepts referring if possible to selected examples. We recommend to define a property with a knowledge of the dimension or most common units used for the variable. Otherwise it can be too much of a guess. Therefore we ask to add units and dimensionts when we submitting an example for decomposition. If you can please also submit a link to a publication or webpage describing the variable.
